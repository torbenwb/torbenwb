# MC Game Development 1 Course Projects

A selection of the Unity game development projects I have worked on for Mastery Coding's Game Development pathway.

Each project was:
* Designed to be intuitive to first-time Unity users / students.
* Tested for usability and reliability with implementation in 800+ classrooms nationwide.
